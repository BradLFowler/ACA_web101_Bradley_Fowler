            <h1>Some Info about Toad</h1>

            <p>Toad is a character who is Princess Peach's attendant and a longtime protector of the Mushroom Kingdom. He is actually a singular character among an entire species of look-alikes (much like Yoshi is to the Yoshi species), leading to confusion over some of his appearances. He usually has the role of a supporting character who tries to help Mario and Luigi on their adventures, although he occasionally has been a main protagonist, such as in Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario 3D World, and his starring roles in Wario's Woods and Kinopio Live. His role as Peach's steward has sometimes instead been given to Toadsworth. He also appears regularly as a playable character in the Mario spin-offs. Since Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Toad's partner in spin-offs has been Toadette. Toad's defining traits are his cartoonish and cutesy appearance, his optimism and humble, his sometimes cowardly personality, and his characteristic smile and voice.</p>
            
            <h2>Roles</h2>

            <p>Often, Toad is made into a tutorial-type character or host, who introduces the player to the game (such as in Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour). Rarely, he plays the role of side-kick and is occasionally a full-fledged hero. He is also occasionally a "damsel-in-distress" (but never the main one). He is usually seen as a helper, giving items and performing various other duties, such as running Toad Houses in Super Mario Bros. 3. His role as a tutorial character and as Peach's caretaker seems to have recently been taken over by Toadsworth. However, this replacement has allowed Toad to take more active roles in the Super Mario games such as having him being the host of the Toad House areas. While he is often featured as a playable character within the various Mario spin-off titles, he sometimes plays the role of the referee within some titles.</p>
